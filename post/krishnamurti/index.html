<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>As a growing young man, I find various challenges in life most of which make
the life itself. For the last few days, I have been trying to work on
somethings, but since they are challenging, I find myself avoiding those, and
distracting myself  into doing some other not so important stuff. I find myself
thinking of things in general as work, and thus I am not able to enjoy it to my
heart&rsquo;s content.</p>
<p>One might say that one should be disciplined. Well that helps, but it helps
getting the work done. It&rsquo;s still like forcing myself to do something because
of so and so reason. I realize that till that &ldquo;so and so reason&rdquo; exists, I
simply cannot enjoy the things that I do. There will always be either something
to gain out of it, or something to lose, if I don&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p>When I feel confident about myself, mostly after completing some quest sort-of
task, I tend to go full on into the &ldquo;work mode&rdquo;. On the other hand, if I feel
otherwise, I avoid the task for as long as I can. I want to be free of this
whole confidence thing. Where I don&rsquo;t have to feel like &ldquo;I know something&rdquo;, or
&ldquo;I suck at it&rdquo; etc.</p>
<p>My generation has another challenge. With Big-Tech companies like google,
facebook, instagram etc. making fortunes from advertisements, most of the
public internet has become user-hostile, with the soul purpose of keeping the
user, or should I say &ldquo;used&rdquo; on the platform for as long as possible.</p>
<p>And not to mention the constant evolution of daily life into a marketplace,
such that one who has senses has to either resist, or opt into an unhealthy
lifestyle. I find more fast/packed food shops than fruit/juice shops anywhere I
go, and even if I find the better, It&rsquo;s a battle to choose the right.</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s the inner world one lives in, where the brain is chattering all
the time comparing itself to others, and feeling less/highly about itself, being
either jealous of others, or ambitious, trying to live images, images which their
favourite content creator shows them, of the rich and fulfilling life, full of
consumption here and consumption there. Phones and internet is trying to fill
every moment of our lives, be it lunch or walks or even washroom. Most of the
people around me don&rsquo;t seem to have these problems, or they don&rsquo;t see these.</p>
<p>I just want to fully immerse myself into things that I find dear to me. So I
want a conflict free way of living where I don&rsquo;t have to bother about all that
I just mentioned. And as per krishnamurti, such a life is possible.</p>

is a series of conversations where Krishnamurti, along with Allan W. Anderson goes into
the very nature of these problems. I will go over all of these, and I am sure
I will find all the answers I am looking for.</p>
